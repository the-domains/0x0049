  I wrote this plugin over a year ago. Recently I needed something to do exactly
  what this plugin does for a checkout page I was working on for a client, and
  after a brief moment of satisfaction at having written something solid enough
  to warrant reuse, I decided to give it a bit of polish. That includes
  rewriting all the comments, because these days I use capitals and periods. I
  suppose the me from a year ago was too cool to use English properly.

You can get it from \[GitHub\](http://0x0049.link/followmejs-gh) with \`git clone https://github.com/0x0049/follow-me.js\` or \[NPM\](http://0x0049.link/followmejs-npm) with \`npm install follow-me-js\` (recommended). All of the documentation is available at both those links, so I won't bother to re-publish that here.
