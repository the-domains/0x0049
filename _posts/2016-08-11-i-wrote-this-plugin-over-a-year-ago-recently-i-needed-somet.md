# Follow Me (jQuery plugin)

"Follow Me" is a jQuery plugin I wrote to make an element follow you up and down as you scroll, but only within the bounds of some parent element.

I wrote this plugin over a year ago. Recently I needed something to do exactly what this plugin does for a checkout page I was working on for a client, and after a brief moment of satisfaction at having written something solid enough to warrant reuse, I decided to give it a bit of polish. That includes rewriting all the comments, because these days I use capitals and periods. I suppose the me from a year ago was too cool to use English properly.

You can get it from [GitHub][0] with \`git clone https://github.com/0x0049/follow-me.js\` or [NPM][1] with \`npm install follow-me-js\` (recommended). All of the documentation is available at both those links, so I won't bother to re-publish that here.

[Check out the demo here][2].
