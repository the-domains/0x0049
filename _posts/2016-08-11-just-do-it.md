# Just do it

I've been putting off a lot for years now, including this site. But this past week has seen some fairly violent changes, thanks largely to these three words.

Update: this website is now hosted on [The Grid][0].

I've redesigned this website six times over the past couple years. Six that I can actively recall. None of those designs were bad. I guess I just grew tired of them. They weren't good enough, or they became not good enough. If nothing changed I would go on redesigning for the rest of my life and never put the site up. No one would ever see the things I wanted to write here.

At one point I spent weeks writing my own blogging platform on Node. (I'm now using Ghost.)

My new goal is to take the most important thing and _just do it_. I'm not trying to win the most redesigned website award, I'm trying to communicate. So let's do it.

I forced myself to scrap my latest design and immediately put up something simple and clean in record time. Even now I cringe at the design and wince at the thought of someone seeing it. I'm not saying I'll never improve the design. I'm not even saying I won't write my own blogging platform (I probably won't). But these things are not going to stand in the way of my goals anymore.

I recently spent 16 hours charting GPU benchmarks and laptop specs in order to find a laptop for my sister-in-law. All I needed was to find the best laptop given a very narrow set of criteria. Instead I decided to map the entirety of the laptop world in a single spreadsheet. This is the kind of thing I tend to do, and often I will burn out, give up, or start over.

When I asked some friends for their thoughts, one of them answered with a perfect laptop in 11 minutes. "Boom, done," he said.

This doesn't mean inferior work. This is _getting things done_, and getting the most _important _things done first.

There you have it. **Boom, done.**
