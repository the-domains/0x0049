            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Just do it</h1><p>I've redesigned this website six times over the past couple years. Six that I can actively recall. None of those designs were bad. I guess I just grew tired of them. They weren't good enough, or they became not good enough. If nothing changed I would go on redesigning for the rest of my life and never put the site up. No one would ever see the things I wanted to write here.</p></article>]]></description>
